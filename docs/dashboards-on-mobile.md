# Dashboards on mobile

The bundled Renault 5 dashboards are designed for phones and **automatically tested** on every
change: a CI job renders them in a real Home Assistant across the top mobile device sizes and
fails the build if any text is truncated or any card fails to render. Typography is the same on
every screen (no font/size changes between phone and desktop); labels and headings **wrap on
clean word breaks** rather than getting cut off.

Devices validated each run: **iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15, iPhone SE, Pixel 8,
Pixel 7a, Galaxy S24, Galaxy S23, Galaxy A54, and a 360 px narrow Android bound.**

> representative sample data; the full per-device set is uploaded as a build artifact on every run.
