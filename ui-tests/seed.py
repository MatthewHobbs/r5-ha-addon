"""Seed a Home Assistant instance for the dashboard UI test.

No MQTT / add-on needed: every entity the dashboards reference is given a representative
state via the REST /api/states API (cards read hass.states regardless of the backing
integration), the custom-card Lovelace resources are registered, and the 'standard' and
'bubble' dashboards are created from the bundled YAML via the WebSocket API.

The problem-class binary sensors the dashboards reference, and the demo entities in TOGGLES, are
rendered in several passes, each a combination production can publish (derive_passes): the normal
pass above, then every named pass listed by --list-passes. --pass <name> reseeds an already-seeded
instance for one of them. With --manifest, either writes the dashboards to check in that pass, the
card labels that must be visible on each, and the Bubble pop-ups to open on each with the labels
that must be visible inside them and, per card the pop-up renders, the texts it must show before
the gate scans it (popup_items, a290's ADR 0003).

Usage: seed.py --base http://localhost:8123 --token <access_token> [--dashboards <dir>]
                [--pass <name>] [--manifest <manifest.json>]
