"""Seed a Home Assistant instance for the dashboard UI test.

No MQTT / add-on needed: every entity the dashboards reference is given a representative
state via the REST /api/states API (cards read hass.states regardless of the backing
integration), the custom-card Lovelace resources are registered, and the 'standard' and
'bubble' dashboards are created from the bundled YAML via the WebSocket API.

The problem-class binary sensors the dashboards reference are rendered in several passes, each a
combination production can publish (derive_passes): the normal pass above, then every named pass
listed by --list-passes. --pass <name> reseeds an already-seeded instance for one of them. With
--manifest, either writes the dashboards to check in that pass and the card labels that must be
visible on each.

Usage: seed.py --base http://localhost:8123 --token <access_token> [--dashboards <dir>]
                [--pass <name>] [--manifest <manifest.json>]
       seed.py --list-passes
