# Dashboard UI tests — responsive / truncation

Renders the bundled dashboards (`renault_5/dashboards/front-end.txt` and
`front-end-bubble.txt`) in a **real Home Assistant** across the top mobile device sizes and
**fails on any text truncation or broken card**. This is what catches regressions like the
Mushroom tile labels clipping on a phone.

## How it works

1. `run.sh` boots a throwaway Home Assistant container, vendors all four custom cards
   (Mushroom, Button Card, card-mod, Bubble Card) as pinned single-file bundles into `www/`
   — served same-origin so no card loads over the network at render time (only the Zen Dots
   webfont is still fetched remotely) — and completes
   onboarding to get an API token.
2. `seed.py` gives every entity the dashboards reference a representative state via the REST
   `/api/states` API — no MQTT or add-on needed, since the cards read `hass.states`
   directly — then registers the card resources and creates the two dashboards from the
   bundled YAML.
3. `check_overflow.py` (Playwright) loads each dashboard at every viewport in `devices.json`,
   waits for the cards and the Zen Dots font, then walks the **shadow-DOM-pierced** tree for
   any text element that is clipped (`text-overflow:ellipsis` / `nowrap`+`overflow:hidden`
   with `scrollWidth > clientWidth`) or any `hui-error-card`. A screenshot is saved per
   device; the run exits non-zero with a report if anything is clipped.

## Device matrix

`devices.json` — the top mobile devices for 2024-25 plus the narrow/wide bounds (CSS
viewport width is the truncation-critical dimension):
iPhone 15 Pro Max / Pro / 15 / SE, Pixel 8 / 7a, Galaxy S24 / S23 / A54, and a 360px Android
narrow bound.

## Run locally

Needs `docker` + `curl` and a Python with `aiohttp PyYAML playwright` (and
`playwright install chromium`):

```bash
PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python bash ui-tests/run.sh
```

Screenshots land in `ui-tests/screenshots/` (git-ignored; uploaded as a CI artifact). In CI
this is the **UI Tests** workflow, which runs whenever the dashboards or this harness change.

## Docs-screenshot drift report

On a PR, a trusted `workflow_run` companion (`.github/workflows/refresh-screenshots.yaml`)
downloads the rendered artifact, resizes the phone shots, and reports whether they differ from
the committed `docs/screenshots/`. If they do, the regenerated PNGs are attached to the run as
the **regenerated-screenshots** artifact; download and commit them yourself if the change is
real. It writes a job summary and nothing else.

**It does not commit, and it never fails the build.** Both are deliberate.

It used to commit refreshed PNGs to the PR head via a GitHub App token, and that raced whoever
was working on the PR: push → render differs → bot commits → head moves → your push is rejected
non-fast-forward, or the `CLEAN` verdict you just read is invalidated and the merge refused. On
the A290 twin that rejected three pushes in one session, twice mid-merge, and moved the head
five times across the two repos. The `[refresh-shots]` guard only stopped the bot re-triggering
*itself*; it did nothing about a human merging that commit and pushing again. CI writing to a
branch a human is working on **is** the race, so CI no longer writes to it — the App token and
its `Contents: write` scope are gone from the workflow entirely.

It reports rather than failing because **the render is not yet reproducible**. Measured on the
A290 twin: two consecutive runs of identical code against the same seed produced 10 of 30
screenshots differing, two at different page *dimensions*. Freezing the CSS animations
(`animations="disabled"` plus `reduced_motion`) and anchoring the seeded timestamps to run time
fixed the fast oscillation; the remaining layout settling must be solved before this can become
a required drift gate. **Treat the committed screenshots as UNTESTED** — a plausible picture,
not a verified one.
