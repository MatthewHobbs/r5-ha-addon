# Dashboard UI tests — responsive / truncation

Renders the bundled dashboards (`renault_5/dashboards/front-end.txt` and
`front-end-bubble.txt`) in a **real Home Assistant** across the top mobile device sizes and
**fails on any text truncation or broken card**. This is what catches regressions like the
Mushroom tile labels clipping on a phone.

## How it works

1. `run.sh` boots a throwaway Home Assistant container, vendors all four custom cards
   (Mushroom, Button Card, card-mod, Bubble Card) as pinned single-file bundles into `www/`
   — served same-origin so no card loads over the network at render time (only the Zen Dots
   webfont is still fetched remotely) — and completes
   onboarding to get an API token.
2. `seed.py` gives every entity the dashboards reference a representative state via the REST
   `/api/states` API — no MQTT or add-on needed, since the cards read `hass.states`
   directly — then registers the card resources and creates the two dashboards from the
   bundled YAML. card-mod is the exception: `run.sh` loads it as a frontend module
   (`extra_module_url`) so it is defined before any card renders; as a resource it can lose
   that race and leave cards unstyled.
3. `check_overflow.py` (Playwright) loads each dashboard at every viewport in `devices.json`,
   waits for the cards and the Zen Dots font, then walks the **shadow-DOM-pierced** tree for
   any text element that is clipped (`text-overflow:ellipsis` / `nowrap`+`overflow:hidden`
   with `scrollWidth > clientWidth`) or any `hui-error-card`. A screenshot is saved per
   device; the run exits non-zero with a report if anything is clipped.
4. **Problem-sensor passes.** The seed is a parked car on a working add-on (Data Stale on,
   Poll Failing and API Auth Failure off), so the rest of what the problem sensors switch (the
   Not Polling and Auth Failure cards, the Last Updated branch of the Last Seen tile) never
   renders in step 3. `seed.py` derives further passes over every problem-class binary sensor
   the dashboards reference (from `catalog.py`, not listed here), and every pass must be a
   state production can publish:
   - `IMPLIES` declares the states production cannot publish apart. Poll Failing is on only
     when the last successful poll is older than `stale_hours`, and the car timestamp Data
     Stale ages came from a poll, so Poll Failing on forces Data Stale on. `DERIVED_AGE` gives
     Battery Last Activity (the timestamp that tile shows, and the one Data Stale ages) the age
     its Data Stale state needs (older than the `stale_hours` default when on, newer when off).
   - **alarm** inverts every problem sensor, then applies `IMPLIES`: Auth Failure and Not
     Polling on, Data Stale left on with its old timestamp.
   - A branch that closure kept off the page gets a pass of its own, named `<sensor>_<state>`:
     today **data_stale_off**, a healthy car with a fresh Last Updated.

   `seed.py --list-passes` prints them; `run.sh` reseeds each with `seed.py --pass <name>` and
   re-checks, with `check_overflow.py --pass-name <name>`, only the dashboards that reference a
   state the pass changed, across the same devices. Each pass reseeds every problem sensor and
   derived timestamp, not only the ones it changes, and reads them back: it stops unless HA
   holds what was seeded and `IMPLIES` and the ages hold, so a state left over from the
   previous pass cannot render.

   Every pass, the normal one included, also fails unless the text its states select is
   visible: the `name` of each conditional card whose conditions they meet, and the chosen
   branch of each text field (`primary`, `secondary`, `name`, `label`, `title`, `heading`,
   `content`) of the form `{% if is_state('<sensor>','<state>') %}A{% else %}B{% endif %}`,
   read from the dashboard file. The seed stops with an error if a text field is templated on
   a problem sensor in any other form, or if a dashboard references a sensor a pass changes but
   no text on it switches with that sensor. The second check is what catches a tile hard-coded
   to one branch: the expected text is read from the same file, so it disappears along with the
   switch, but the sensor is still referenced by the tile's icon and colour templates. It
   cannot catch a change that removes every reference to the sensor, and it names the sensor,
   not the lost text. Not asserted: icons, colours and `card_mod` styles keyed on those sensors
   (they are rendered and truncation-checked, but carry no text), and pop-up content opened by
   a tap. `IMPLIES` holds only the relations declared in it; one production gains is not
   checked until it is added there. A named pass's screenshots are
   `<dashboard>__<pass>__<device>.png`, so they never overwrite the normal pass's.

## Device matrix

`devices.json` — the top mobile devices for 2024-25 plus the narrow/wide bounds (CSS
viewport width is the truncation-critical dimension):
iPhone 15 Pro Max / Pro / 15 / SE, Pixel 8 / 7a, Galaxy S24 / S23 / A54, and a 360px Android
narrow bound.

## Run locally

Needs `docker` + `curl` and a Python with `aiohttp PyYAML playwright` (and
`playwright install chromium`):

```bash
PYTHON=/path/to/venv/bin/python bash ui-tests/run.sh
```

Screenshots land in `ui-tests/screenshots/` (git-ignored; uploaded as a CI artifact). In CI
this is the **UI Tests** workflow, which runs whenever the dashboards or this harness change.

## Docs-screenshot drift report

On a PR, a trusted `workflow_run` companion (`.github/workflows/refresh-screenshots.yaml`)
downloads the rendered artifact, resizes the phone shots, and reports whether they differ from
the committed `docs/screenshots/`. If they do, the regenerated PNGs are attached to the run as
the **regenerated-screenshots** artifact; download and commit them yourself if the change is
real. It writes a job summary and nothing else.

**It does not commit, and it never fails the build.** Both are deliberate.

It used to commit refreshed PNGs to the PR head via a GitHub App token, and that raced whoever
was working on the PR: push → render differs → bot commits → head moves → your push is rejected
non-fast-forward, or the `CLEAN` verdict you just read is invalidated and the merge refused. On
the A290 twin that rejected three pushes in one session, twice mid-merge, and moved the head
five times across the two repos. The `[refresh-shots]` guard only stopped the bot re-triggering
*itself*; it did nothing about a human merging that commit and pushing again. CI writing to a
branch a human is working on **is** the race, so CI no longer writes to it — the App token and
its `Contents: write` scope are gone from the workflow entirely.

It reports rather than failing because **the render is not yet reproducible**. Measured on the
A290 twin: two consecutive runs of identical code against the same seed produced 10 of 30
screenshots differing, two at different page *dimensions*. Freezing the CSS animations
(`animations="disabled"` plus `reduced_motion`) and anchoring the seeded timestamps to run time
fixed the fast oscillation; the remaining layout settling must be solved before this can become
a required drift gate. **Treat the committed screenshots as UNTESTED** — a plausible picture,
not a verified one.
