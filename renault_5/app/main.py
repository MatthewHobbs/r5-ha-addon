"""Renault 5 add-on — poll the Renault/Kamereon API and publish to HA via MQTT discovery.

A maintained MQTT data layer for the Renault 5 E-Tech, replacing the venv + renault-api
CLI + shell-script layer of Topolino65's renault-5-dashboard-view. Entities follow that
project's naming (modernised, locale-aware). Same renault-api endpoints as the Alpine
A290 add-on this is ported from (R5 E-Tech and A290 share the CMF-BEV / KCM platform).

Read endpoints: battery-status, cockpit, HVAC, location, ev/settings (preconditioning),
ev/soc-levels, plus optional charge-mode and tyre-pressure (gated on supports_endpoint).
Command buttons (ACTION_BUTTONS): Start Charging (KCM instant-charge), Flash Lights, Sound
Horn, and HVAC Start/Stop — all sent natively via renault-api, so **Home Assistant's `renault` integration is not required at all**. Each button is gated on supports_endpoint(), so a
control the platform forbids is never shown (all five are supported on the R5). HVAC-start
targets the car's configured preconditioning temperature (falling back to 21°C). One cached
login is reused across polls (VehicleSession) rather than re-authenticating every cycle.
Plug stuck-detection + charge-session tracking + health sensors persist to /data/state.json.

Platform caveats (R5 E-Tech / CMF-BEV, KCM): batteryCapacity is always 0 (we use the
configured capacity); chargingStatus is a float ChargeState (0.0/0.2/1.0/-1.0/… — decoded
via the library enum, not just 0/1/-1); chargingInstantaneousPower units are unreliable;
batteryTemperature is sometimes absent; internalTemperature (cabin temp) is populated but
often only shortly after HVAC activity, so it can be null/unavailable.
