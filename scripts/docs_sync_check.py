"""docs-sync-check: enforce the documentation rules instead of trusting them.

CLAUDE.md says a user-facing change bumps `config.yaml` version and adds a CHANGELOG entry,
and that the options table and entity lists in the docs describe what the code publishes.
Those were checklist items, not checks, so they drifted: `stale_hours` was documented as
"mark data stale after this many hours without a successful poll" long after the option had
stopped meaning that, and it was only caught by reading the docs during an unrelated fix.

This fails a PR that changes a documented surface WITHOUT touching its documentation. It is a
GATE, not a generator — it never edits docs; it tells you which doc you owe.

Deliberately narrow. Three triggers, each chosen because it has (near) zero false positives:

  1. the set of add-on OPTIONS changed          -> DOCS.md must be updated
  2. the set of published ENTITIES changed      -> DOCS.md or a dashboards/*.md must be updated
  3. config.yaml `version` changed              -> CHANGELOG.md must carry that exact version

Plus one invariant checked on every PR, bump or not: CHANGELOG history is append-above only.
Every `## <version>` heading at the merge base must still be there, once, in the same order, and
a version heading the PR adds must sit above all of them. Check 3 alone passed an edit that
REWROTE the previous heading into the new version instead of adding above it (r5 #92, #93): the
new heading exists, the old release is gone. Non-version `##` sections (`## Unreleased`) are not
entries, so they may go anywhere.
Changed TEXT under a released heading only warns: 8 of the 112 CHANGELOG commits on the two
mains did that, mostly to correct a wrong claim, a name or a dead link.

Cosmetic edits do not trigger it: renaming an icon, reordering a table, editing a comment, or
changing code that publishes nothing new. That is the point — a required check that constantly
needs waiving trains people to wave it through.

Escape hatch: the exact lowercase `docs-sync-ok` PR label, for a genuinely doc-neutral change.
It waives checks 1-3 only. It never waives CHANGELOG history: no doc-neutral change needs to
delete, rename, reorder or bury a release.

Usage: docs_sync_check.py [base-ref]        (default: origin/main)
       docs_sync_check.py --self-test
Env:   LABELS   comma-joined PR label names, supplied by the workflow

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = documentation owed or CHANGELOG history lost, 2 = the check itself could
not run (never silently passes — an unfetched base must be loud, or the gate quietly stops
gating).
