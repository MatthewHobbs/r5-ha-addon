"""Fail when the a290 and r5 add-on trees differ in any way the expected list does not explain.

Shared verbatim by a290-ha-addon and r5-ha-addon (ADR 0001 in a290), so it knows neither repo
by name. Everything model-specific is data under scripts/parity/ in the repo that runs it:

  map.tsv       how the derived tree's names are rewritten onto the canonical tree's, and
                which files are compared raw, skipped, or compared with whitespace collapsed
  expected.tsv  every difference allowed to remain, each with a category, a count and a reason

Roles come from map.tsv's `side` rows, not from which repo runs the check: whichever tree
holds the canonical marker file is canonical. So both repos run the same command:

  python3 scripts/parity_check.py --twin <path to the other repo>

Each tree must be a git checkout: its tracked files and tracked modes are compared, so local
junk never counts. A tree that is not one is refused unless --walk is given, and the output
always says which listing each tree used.

What it fails on, each of which is a separate check:
  - a differing line, file mode, binary or one-sided file that no expected entry covers;
  - two files in one tree that map to the same canonical path (an error naming both);
  - an expected entry that covers nothing: the difference it excused is gone (stale);
  - an entry whose count is not exactly the number of items it covered, so a new line
    cannot hide under an old excuse and a partly-fixed one is noticed;
  - a malformed map or list (unknown category, pending without a Target:, bad regex).

Each repo reads its OWN copy of map.tsv and expected.tsv, and those two files are never
compared across the pair: a list edit in one repo must not turn the other repo red. The two
copies converge anyway, because each must describe exactly the same set of differences.

Exit: 0 pass, 1 parity failure, 2 usage or configuration error.
